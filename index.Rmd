# Preface {-}

We have entered a time in which vast amounts of data are more widely
available than ever before. At the same time, a new set of tools has
been developed to analyze this data and provide decision makers with
information to help them accomplish their goals. Those who engage with
data and interpret it for organizational leaders have taken to calling
themselves data scientists, and their craft data science. Other terms
that have come into vogue are "Big Data," "Predictive Analytics" and
"Data Mining." These can seem to be mysterious domains. The point of
this class is to demystify much of this endeavor for individuals who
will be organizational leaders.

The class is structured around developing students' skills in three
areas: getting data, analyzing data to make predictions, and
presenting the results of analysis. For each area, the subtopics are
as follows:

Getting Data Topics
--------------------
* Tools of the Trade: R and Rstudio, git and Github
* Working with pre-processed data and flat files
* Getting data from the web: webscraping, using forms, using Application Programming Interfaces
* Using databases

Analyzing Data Topics
----------------------
* Conditional means
* Regression
* Supervised learning: classification
* Unsupervised learning: K-means and nearest neighbors clustering
* Evaluating multiple models

Presenting Data Analysis Topics
---------------------------------
* Descriptives: histograms, density plots, bar plots, dot
  plots
* Scatterplots
* Lattice graphics and small multiples
* Maps
* Interactive Graphics
